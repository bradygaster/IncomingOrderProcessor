## Modernization Recommendations

### 1. Convert to SDK-Style Projects

Legacy project format detected. Convert to SDK-style projects for better tooling support and easier dependency management.

**Steps:**
- Use try-convert tool or manual conversion
- Remove packages.config, use PackageReference
- Simplify .csproj by removing auto-generated items

### 2. Migrate Windows Services to Azure Functions

Windows Services detected. Consider Azure Functions for serverless execution.

**Steps:**
- Identify trigger patterns (timer, queue, event)
- Create Azure Functions with appropriate triggers
- Migrate business logic to function handlers
- Configure scaling and monitoring

### 3. Implement Cloud-Native Patterns

Adopt cloud-native patterns for resilience and scalability.

**Steps:**
- Externalize configuration to Azure App Configuration
- Use Azure Key Vault for secrets management
- Implement health checks and readiness probes
- Add Application Insights for observability

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Long-running process migration | Medium | Medium | Use Durable Functions for complex workflows |
| Testing coverage gaps | Medium | Medium | Add integration tests before migration |
| Performance regression | Low | Medium | Establish performance baselines and benchmarks |

---

## Next Steps

1. Review this assessment report with stakeholders
2. Prioritize applications for migration waves
3. Set up development and testing environments
4. Consider proof-of-concept for highest-risk components
5. Create detailed migration plan with timelines
6. Prepare infrastructure as code templates
7. Begin migration following the playbook
